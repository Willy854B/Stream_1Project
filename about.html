				<p>"The Monkees" has been a fixture on rock and pop music for well over five decades. It has evolved from its early days as a tv show rock band into one of the most successful music groups in the US and around the world. We were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider for the American television series The Monkees which aired from 1966 to 1968. Screen Gems executive producer Don Kirshner came up with the idea of creating the tv show, which marked the beginning of the band in its early days until now. Since early 1960's, our musical acting quartet have sold more than 50 million records worldwide and had international hits, including "Last Train to Clarkville", "Pleasant Valley Sanday", "Day Dream Beleaver", and "I'm a Beleaver".</p>
