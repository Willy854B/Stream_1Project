### What is this app for?
This is a reservation app. it provides users the ability to book an event.
### What does it do?
This app will allow users to enter some personal information, a specific date, and the number of hours they want to hire the band for. After that, this tool will check if the band is available on the chosen date, give information about the cost, and allow the user to book the event only if the band is available on the date entered by the user.
### How does it work
This app uses JavaScrip code to get the values entered by the user in the HTML form. Based on these values, this tool checks if the date of the event entered by the user is already stored in an array of objects. If it is, it will ask the user to choose a different date. Once an available date is entered, this app will store all these information as a new object, and provide the cost associated with various types of booking.
